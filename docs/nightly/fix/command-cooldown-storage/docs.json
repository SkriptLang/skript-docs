For blocks, 'Age' represents the different growth stages that a crop-like block can go through. A value of 0 indicates that the crop was freshly planted, whilst a value equal to 'maximum age' indicates that the crop is ripe and ready to be harvested.
For entities, 'Age' represents the time left for them to become adults and it's in minus increasing to be 0 which means they're adults, e.g. A baby cow needs 20 minutes to become an adult which equals to 24,000 ticks so their age will be -24000 once spawned.",
  "examples" : "# Set targeted crop to fully grown crop\\nset age of targeted block to maximum age of targeted block\\n \\n# Spawn a baby cow that will only need 1 minute to become an adult\\nspawn a baby cow at player\\nset age of last spawned entity to -1200 # in ticks = 60 seconds"

- The list variable will contain the parsed values from all %types% in the pattern in order. If a type was plural, e.g. %items%, the variable's value at the respective index will be a list variable, e.g. the values will be stored in {parsed::1::*}, not {parsed::1}.",
