    <h1 id="nav-title">Variables</h1>
    <div id="content-no-docs" class="no-left-panel" style="padding-top: 32px;">
        <h1 class="title">Variables</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"> Skript's events, commands, and effects are rather useful on their own, but you need
            variables to really
            get the most out of Skript. They allow you to store data, move data around, make code readable, and much
            more.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"> At their core, variables are a label for information. If you've taken algebra in math
            class, you probably understand the concept. Instead of using an actual number, you use x or y as a stand-in
            for an unknown or changing number. This is the same concept as variables in programming. Variables are
            representations, or stand-ins, of unknown or changing data. You could also think of them as a little
            labelled box that you can put things into.</p>
        <h2 class="title">Using Variables in Skript</h2>
        <p class="subtitle"> In Skript, variables are represented by a variable name contained within two curly braces,
            like so:</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            set {variable} to 1<br>
            set {_variable} to 2<br>
            set {hey, what's going on} to "not much, what about you?"
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> Variables can be have nearly any name you'd like. They have have spaces, dashes, symbols,
            whatever. The only exception is the asterisk, <code>*</code>, which is used as the list wildcard and will be
            explained later. There are also different types of variables which depend on how you write the variable's
            name, but that will be explained in a moment as well.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"> First, an example. Here's a quick and dirty /home script, with a major flaw. See if you can
            spot it.</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            command /sethome:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set {home} to player's location<br>
            <br>
            command /home:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teleport player to {home}
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> Before we get into the flaw, notice the usefulness of the variable. We can communicate
            information from one command to another, and it doesn't matter how long of an interval is between to the two
            commands. The data is stored in the variable and all we need to do to use it is look inside.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"> Now, the flaw. What happens if a player uses the <code>/sethome</code> command, but then a
            second player uses the <code>/home</code> command? The second player will be teleported to the first
            player's home. This is because the variable is <b>global</b>.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Variable Types</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"> There are two main types of variables in Skript: global vars and local vars. The main
            differences between the two can be summarized in the following table, but a more detailed explanation will
            follow.</p>
        <table class="colors-table">
            <tr>
                <td> </td>
                <td>Global Variables</td>
                <td>Local Variables</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Scope</td>
                <td>Can be accessed from any trigger, in any script, at any time.</td>
                <td>Can only be accessed from the trigger it was created in, and only for that instance of the trigger.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Persistence</td>
                <td>Data is saved permanently, including through server restarts.</td>
                <td>Data is saved temporarily, disappearing when the trigger is finished.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Uniqueness</td>
                <td>Since the variable can be accessed anywhere, it must be given a unique name manually to avoid
                    collisions.</td>
                <td>Each variable is tied to its own trigger, and will not conflict with any other variables of the same
                    name.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Main Use</td>
                <td>Storing data that needs to be accessed from multiple triggers, or for storing data that needs to
                    persist over time. For example: warps, player statistics. </td>
                <td>Storing data that is only needed temporarily and only in one location. For example: creating an item
                    to give a player, keeping track of a loop's iterations.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2 class="title">Global Variables</h2>
        <p class="subtitle"> Global variables are variables that can be used anywhere in any of your scripts. If you set
            it to 1 is one place, it'll be 1 the next time you look at it, no matter what's doing the looking. This
            makes them ideal for storing long-term data, like player stats, or for communicating between different parts
            of your scripts.</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            command /stop-loop:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set {stop-loop} to true<br>
            <br>
            # running the /stop-loop command can stop this loop, despite being a different trigger.<br>
            on load:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while {stop-loop} is not set:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broadcast "ping"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait 1 second
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> See how the variable is used in two different triggers? That's the power of global
            variables. Global vars are also stored to your server's hard drive, so they'll stick around if you restart.
            You can find them in <code>variables.csv</code>, but it's recommended to not mess with that file in case
            things get messed up.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"> However, as powerful as global variables are, they have a big shortcoming. Back when we
            introduced that <code>/home</code> script, we mentioned that the homes weren't unique to each player, it was
            just one home that anyone could set and anyone could teleport to. To fix this, we can make the variable
            specific to the player by including the player's uuid in the name:</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            command /sethome:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set {home::%uuid of player%} to player's location<br>
            <br>
            command /home:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teleport player to {home::%uuid of player%}
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> Now, each player has their own home and they can't teleport to anyone else's. We're using
            <code>::</code> as a separator to make it a list, which will be explained later. Suffice to say, it gives us
            a little more control over the variable in the future. You should, in general, use <code>::</code> over
            other separators like <code>.</code>.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title">Local Variables</h2>
        <p class="subtitle"> Local variables are variables that can only be accessed from the trigger they were created
            in. They're not stored to the hard drive like global vars are, so they'll disappear when the trigger is
            finished. This makes them
            ideal for storing temporary data. For example, let's look at this particle command:</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            command /particles:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set {location} to player's location<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop 20 times:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show lava at {location}<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait 5 ticks
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> This command is supposed to show some lava particles at the place the command was executed.
            However, if the command is executed again while the loop is still running, all the particles will move to
            the new location. It's the same problem as with the <code>/home</code> command, but now we can't really use
            player uuids to make the names unique. Furthermore, we don't even want to save this info! It's not useful
            once the command is finished.</p>
        <p class="subtitle"> To fix this, we can use a local variable. Local variables are created by putting a
            <code>_</code> character at the start of a variable's name. These have slightly different properties. They
            only stick around in the same trigger that they were created in. If you make one in <code>/sethome</code>,
            it won't be accessible in <code>/home</code>. However, since they won't ever collide with any other variable
            of the same name, they're great for information that doesn't need to leave the trigger.
        </p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            command /particles:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set {_location} to player's location<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop 20 times:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show lava at {_location}<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait 5 ticks
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> Now, we can execute <code>/particles</code> as many times as we want and each location will
            be separate from the last. Each instance of running the command creates a new version of our location
            variable, which doesn't conflict with any of the others.</p>
        <h1 class="title">Lists</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"> Lists are a feature of variables that allow them to store multiple values. They're created
            by using <code>::</code> as a separator. For example, we can create a list of all the players on the server
            with:</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            set {players::*} to all players
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> This will create a list of all the players on the server. We can then access the list all
            at once with <code>{players::*}</code>, or individually, like getting the first player in the list:
            <code>{players::1}</code>.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle"> List variables can be added to, removed from, or deleted all at once. Most expressions and
            effects support lists as well, so you can kill a whole list of entities all at once, with a single line.</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            set {list::*} to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5<br>
            add 6 to {list::*}<br>
            remove 2 from {list::*}<br>
            broadcast {list::*} # broadcasts "1, 3, 4, 5, and 6"<br>
            delete {list::*}
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> When you put something into a list by using <code>add</code>, or setting the whole list at
            once, it's put under a number like <code>{players::1}</code>, where 1 means the first element. This is
            called the index, while the thing itself is called the value.</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            set {variable name::index} to "value"
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> As you can see above, you can set specific indices to specific values. This is actually
            something we already saw with the <code>/home</code> command! There, we created a list called
            <code>home</code> and used the player's uuid as the index. We stored the location as the value.
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle"> This means we can use all the abilities that lists provide on the list of homes! We could
            loop all the homes, we could delete them all at once, we could broadcast them all, whatever we want! </p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            command /home-list:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trigger:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loop {home::*}:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broadcast "%loop-index parsed as
            offlineplayer%'s home is at %loop-value%"
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> This command will broadcast the location of every home on the server. You can see how we
            get the player from their uuid by using <code>loop-index</code>, and the location by using
            <code>loop-value</code>.
        </p>
        <h1 class="title">Options and the Variables Section</h1>
        <h1 class="title">Options</h2>
        <p class="subtitle"> Options are a special tool. They're literally replaced before the script gets parsed,
            so unlike variables it's like literally typing out whatever the option is. This makes them very useful
            for things like little configs, or some bit of code you have to type out a ton. They follow the
            following pattern:</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            options:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;option name: value<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example: 6 + 7 / 2<br>
            <br>
            on load:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broadcast "{@option name}" # broadcasts "value"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broadcast "{@example}" # broadcasts "6 + 7 / 2"<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broadcast {@example} # broadcasts "9.5"
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> As you can see, options can be very powerful since they can represent any amount of
            code. However, over-using options is a great way to cause hard-to-find bugs and severely impact your
            parsing times. Remeber, even if it looks shorter to you, it's the same length when Skript goes to parse
            it. </p>
        <p class="subtitle"> Options are best used as a small config file to make key values easier to change. If
            you're using it to reduce the amount of code you need to write, consider instead a global variable set
            in an on load event, or even a function.</p>
        <h1 class="title">The Variables Section</h1>
        <p class="subtitle"> The variables section is a special section that allows you to give variables default
            values. There are two main things it can do. One, set a variable if it isn't already set <b>when the
                script is loaded</b>. This works the same as setting a variable in an on load event, but it will
            only set it when the variable isn't already set.</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            variables:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{variable name} = "value"
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> The other main thing is it can give a variable a default value. This can be extremely
            useful for things like lists, but be careful, it can be finicky.</p>
        <div class="box skript-code-block left-margin">
            variables:<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{variable name::%player%} = "value"
        </div>
        <p class="subtitle"> Now, whenever you ask for <code>{variable name::%some player%}</code>, no matter what
            player, it'll give you "value". Again, it won't override any values that are already set, so don't try
            to change existing lists using this feature, it's for, as the name suggests, default values.</p>
