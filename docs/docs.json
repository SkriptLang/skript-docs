- The pattern must be a <a href='./patterns/'>Skript pattern</a>, e.g. percent signs are used to define where to parse which types, e.g. put a %number% or %items% in the pattern if you expect a number or some items there.
- You <i>have to</i> save the expression's value in a list variable, e.g. <code>set {parsed::*} to message parsed as \"...\"</code>.
- The list variable will contain the parsed values from all %types% in the pattern in order. If a type was plural, e.g. %items%, the variable's value at the respective index will be a list variable, e.g. the values will be stored in {parsed::1::*}, not {parsed::1}.",
